# leaflet-challenge

This assignment involved visualizing earthquake data for the United States Geological Survey also known as USGS. This will allow USGS to better educate the public and other government organizations (and potenitally secure more funding) on issues facing our planet. I was able to develop an earthquake visualization based on a dataset for the past 30 days from the USGS GeoJSON Feed page. I used Leaflet to create a map that plots all the earthquakes from my dataset based on their longitude and latitude.
