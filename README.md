# leaflet-challenge

This assignment involved visualizing earthquake data for the United States Geological Survey also known as USGS. This will allow USGS to better educate the public and other government organizations (and potenitally secure more funding) on issues facing our planet. I was able to develop an earthquake visualization based on a dataset for the past 30 days from the USGS GeoJSON Feed page. 

This project required using Leaflet to create a map that plots all the earthquakes from a dataset based on their longitude and latitude. I was able to create data markers that reflected the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and the depth of the earthquake by color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger, and earthquakes with greater depth appear darker in color. This visualization includes popups that provides additional information about the earthquake when its associated marker is selected. Also, I created a legend that provides context for the map data.

This was a very interesting assignment, because I was able to learn more about javascript and how to develop maps for analysis. If it was not for this course, I would have never thought about creating a map layout for visualization. It was very intriguing being able to approach this task to learn something new through a technnical perspective.
